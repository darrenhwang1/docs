For Loop blocks enable you to process multiple workflow blocks repeatedly for each item in a list.

## How It Works

A For Loop block allows you to repeat workflow actions over a given list. It requires two components:

1. **Value**: A list of items you want to process
2. **Name**: A variable name to reference each item during the loop execution

## Working with Loop Items

During iteration, you can reference the current item using:

- `{name.value}` - represents the current item's value
- `{name.key}` - represents the index position in the list (0, 1, 2, etc.)

<Note>
  When using the AI Assistant to add workflow blocks inside a For Loop, the
  assistant will always perform the action with the context of the first item in
  the list.
</Note>

## Example Use Case

Let's say you want to extract contact information from multiple LinkedIn profiles:

- **Value**: `[linkedin.com/profile1, linkedin.com/profile2, linkedin.com/profile3]`
- **Name**: `linkedin_url`

The workflow blocks inside the For Loop will execute for each URL, with `linkedin_url` representing the current profile being processed.

<Note>The Value field must always be a list of items.</Note>
