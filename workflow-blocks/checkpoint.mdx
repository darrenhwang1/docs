# Checkpoint Block

Checkpoint blocks allow you to create validation points in your workflow using natural language assertions. If an assertion fails, the workflow stops immediately to prevent incorrect execution.

## Overview

Checkpoints help ensure:

- Data consistency
- Process accuracy
- Validation at critical steps
- Safe workflow execution

## Example

Consider an invoice submission workflow. Before submitting the invoice, you want to verify the totals are correct:

Prompt: "Assert that the total of the invoice matches the total of the items listed"
