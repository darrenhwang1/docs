# Extraction Block

Extraction blocks allow you to pull and analyze data from the currently viewed webpage.

## Overview

Extraction blocks can:

- Read and collect data from webpage elements
- Process the extracted data based on specific criteria
- Return filtered or analyzed results

## Examples

```
Prompt: "Read me all companies listed on the page"
```

## Storing and Referencing Results

Data extraction results are automatically stored in the variable associated with the block's name. You can reference these results in subsequent blocks using the syntax `{block_name}`, where `block_name` is the name you assigned to the extraction block.
