# Conditional Block

Conditional blocks allow your workflow to make decisions by executing specific actions only when certain conditions are met.

## How It Works

A Conditional block evaluates a statement that results in either True or False. If the condition is True, the workflow blocks inside the conditional will execute.

## Writing Conditions

You can write conditions in natural language or use basic values:

### Basic Values

- `True` or `1`: Always evaluates to True
- `False` or `0`: Always evaluates to False

### Natural Language Examples

- "Are there more than 5 search results?"
- "Is the user's email verified?"
- "Does the response contain an error?"

## Example Use Case

Let's say you're building a recruiting agent that only sends messages to candidates with the name of "Alice" or "Bob:

Condition: "Is the candidates name Alice or Bob?"

- If True: Action workflow block to send a message to the candidate

## Key Features

- Write conditions in plain English
- Make dynamic decisions in your workflow
- Control which actions execute based on specific criteria
- Combine with other blocks for complex logic
