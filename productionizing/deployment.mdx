# Deploying Your Agent

Deploying your agent to production is a straightforward process that can be completed with a single click.

## Productionizing Your Agent

1. Navigate to your agent in the builder
2. Click the "Productionize" button in the top right corner
3. Your agent will be moved to production and you'll receive an API endpoint

## Using Your Deployed Agent

Once deployed, you can invoke your agent using a simple CURL command:

```
curl -X POST https://backend.trykura.com/run_agent \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "agent_id": "fe1593dcf7c64ef1acac576a4909b71a",
  "parameters": {param_0: "value_0", param_1: "value_1", ...},
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}'
```
