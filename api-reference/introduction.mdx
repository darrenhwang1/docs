## Welcome to Kura API

Welcome to the Kura API documentation! This guide will help you understand how to interact with Kura's powerful agent system through our API endpoints.

### What You'll Find Here

This documentation covers all the API endpoints you need to:

- Initiate and manage agent runs
- Retrieve data and results from your agent sessions

### Key Concepts

In Kura, when you start an agent to perform a task, we call this specific execution a "session." Each session represents a single run of an agent with its own context, inputs, and outputs.
