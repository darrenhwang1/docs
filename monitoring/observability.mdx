# Monitoring Your Agent

Keep track of your agent's performance and execution history through our comprehensive monitoring dashboard.

- Performance metrics
- Execution logs

To access this information, simply:

1. Navigate to your agent in the dashboard
2. View the "Sessions" section to see all executions
3. Click on any specific session to see detailed information
