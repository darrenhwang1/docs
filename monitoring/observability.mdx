# Monitoring Your Agent

Keep track of your agent's performance and execution history through our Agent Dashboard.

## Agent Dashboard

All runs of your agents, both past and current, can be viewed directly in the Agent Dashboard. This provides you with:

- Real-time execution status
- Historical run data
- Execution logs
- Videos associated with each run

To access this information, simply:

1. Click on "My Agents" from the homepage
2. This will take you to the Agent Dashboard where you can see all your agents
3. View all past and present runs for any of your agents
4. Click on any specific run to see detailed information including execution logs and videos

## Session Viewer

You can also view and share specific agent sessions through our session viewer.
