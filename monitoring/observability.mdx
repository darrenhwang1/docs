# Monitoring Your Agent

Keep track of your agent's performance and execution history through our Session Viewer tab.

## Agent Dashboard

All runs of your agent, both past and current, can be viewed directly in the agent dashboard. This provides you with:

- Real-time execution status
- Historical run data
- Execution logs

To access this information, simply:

1. Navigate to your agent in the dashboard
2. Click on the "Sessions" tab to see all executions
3. Click on any specific session to see detailed information
