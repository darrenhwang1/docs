<Note type="warning">
  For now, it's crucial to limit your instructions to one action at a time. This
  ensures the AI Assistant can accurately interpret and implement your intended
  workflow step. See [example instructions](#example-instructions) below for an
  idea of how to structure your instructions.
</Note>

The AI Assistant is a powerful tool that helps you build workflows more efficiently by converting natural language instructions into concrete workflow blocks.

## Overview

AI Assistant allows you to quickly build your workflow by providing in natural language the next action you want your agent to take. It maps your natural language instructions to the actual workflow blocks and asks for your confirmation before making any changes.

## Supported Blocks

Currently, the AI Assistant supports adding the following types of blocks:

- **Extraction Blocks**: For extracting data from web pages
- **Navigation Blocks**: For navigating between different pages and elements
- **Action Blocks**: For performing specific actions on web elements

## How It Works

1. **Describe Your Intent**: Simply tell the AI Assistant what you want your agent to do next in plain English. Keep it focused on a single action at a time
2. **Review Suggestion**: The AI Assistant will suggest the appropriate workflow block and configuration
3. **Confirm or Modify**: Accept the suggestion or request modifications before the block is added to your workflow

### Block Placement

The AI Assistant will insert new workflow blocks at your currently selected position. You can see where the block will be inserted at the top of the AI Assistant panel.

  />
</Frame>

To specify where you want to add a new block:

1. Click between existing blocks to highlight a gap
2. The selected gap will be highlighted, indicating where the new block will be inserted

<Frame>
  <img
    width="400"
    src="/images/selected-gap.png"
    alt="Example of a selected gap between blocks"
  />
</Frame>

If no gap is highlighted, new blocks will be added to the end of your workflow by default.

## Best Practices

- Be specific in your instructions to get more accurate suggestions
- Review the suggestion carefully before confirming
- Use natural, conversational language - no need for technical terms
- Focus on one action per instruction for best results

### Example Instructions

**Instead of writing:**

```
Login with username: example@example.com and password: hunter2
```

**Break it down into steps:**

1. "Type example@example.com into the username field"
2. "Type hunter2 into the password field"
3. "Click the login button"
