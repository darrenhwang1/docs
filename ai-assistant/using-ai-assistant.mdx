The AI Assistant is a powerful tool that helps you build workflows more efficiently by converting natural language instructions into concrete workflow blocks.

## Overview

AI Assistant allows you to quickly build your workflow by providing natural language instructions for the actions you want your agent to take. It maps your instructions to the actual workflow blocks and asks for your confirmation before making any changes.

## Supported Blocks

Currently, the AI Assistant supports adding the following types of blocks:

- **Extraction Blocks**: For extracting data from web pages
- **Navigation Blocks**: For navigating between different pages and elements
- **Action Blocks**: For performing specific actions on web elements

## How It Works

1. **Describe Your Intent**: Tell the AI Assistant what you want your agent to do in plain English.
2. **Review Suggestion**: The AI Assistant will suggest the appropriate workflow blocks and configurations
3. **Confirm or Modify**: Accept the suggestions or request modifications before the blocks are added to your workflow
4. **Automatic Execution**: As each workflow block is added, the assistant automatically executes the workflow block in the browser, performing the corresponding action in real-time

### Block Placement

The AI Assistant will insert new workflow blocks at your currently selected position. You can see where the block will be inserted at the top of the AI Assistant panel.

To specify where you want to add a new block:

1. Click between existing blocks to highlight a gap
2. The selected gap will be highlighted, indicating where the new block will be inserted

<Frame>
  <img
    width="400"
    src="/images/selected-gap.png"
    alt="Example of a selected gap between blocks"
  />
</Frame>

If no gap is highlighted, new blocks will be added to the end of your workflow by default.

## Best Practices

- Be clear and specific in your instructions to get more accurate suggestions
- Review the suggestions carefully before confirming
- Use natural, conversational language - no need for technical terms
- You can now include multiple actions in a single instruction, but for complex workflows, consider breaking them into logical groups

### Example Instructions

**You can use simple, single-action instructions:**

- "Type example@example.com into the username field"
- "Click the login button"

**Or comprehensive multi-action instructions:**

```
Login with username: example@example.com and password: hunter2
```

**And even more complex sequences:**

```
Go to the products page, find the first item with a 5-star rating, add it to the cart, and proceed to checkout
```
