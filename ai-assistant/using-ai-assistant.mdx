# Using the AI Assistant

The AI Assistant converts your natural language instructions into workflow blocks automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Type what you want** - Tell the AI Assistant what actions you need in plain English
2. **Confirm or modify** - Approve the suggestion or ask for changes
3. **Watch it work** - The Assistant executes on the web-page in real-time and adds the corresponding blocks to your workflow

## Examples of What You Can Type

**Simple instructions:**

- "Type example@example.com into the username field"
- "Click the login button"

**Multi-step instructions:**

- "Login with username: example@example.com and password: hunter2"
- "Go to the products page, find the first item with a 5-star rating, add it to the cart, and proceed to checkout"

## Tips for Best Results

- Be specific about what you want
- Use everyday language - no technical terms needed
- Review suggestions before confirming
- For complex workflows, you can break them into logical groups of instructions as if you were giving instructions to a new hire
