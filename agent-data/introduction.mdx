Agent data is a crucial aspect of building effective automation workflows. This section covers how data moves through your agents, from inputs to output, and how to manage variables along the way.

## Key Concepts

### Data Flow

Data in agents follows a clear path:

1. **Inputs** - Data provided to the agent when it starts
2. **Variables** - Data stored, extracted, and used during execution
3. **Output** - The output produced by the agent
