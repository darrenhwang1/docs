Agent inputs are the initial data provided to your agent when executing. They define the parameters and data that your agent will be provided with during execution.

## Defining Inputs

Inputs are defined in the Agent Builder under the "Inputs" section.

Each input requires:

- A name
- A type (string, number, boolean, or json)
- A default value used when testing in the Builder

## Input Types

The following input types are supported:

- `string`: Text values
- `number`: Numeric values
- `boolean`: True/false values
- `json`: Complex objects and arrays
- `totp`: Time-based One-Time Password secrets

## Sensitive Inputs

We also support sensitive inputs, such as passwords or API keys. These inputs are:

- Masked in the UI
- Never passed to LLMs
- Securely handled throughout the agent execution process

To mark an input as sensitive, select the "Mark as sensitive" checkbox when creating or editing an input.

### TOTP Authentication for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

The `totp` input type is a special sensitive input that takes a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) secret and automatically generates the corresponding 6-digit code for use in multi-factor authentication flows. This allows your agents to securely authenticate with services that use authenticator apps for MFA without manually generating codes.

When you provide a TOTP secret as input, the system will:

1. Generate the current valid 6-digit code
2. Make this code available to your agent
3. Never expose the original TOTP secret to the LLM

## Example

Let's say I'm building an agent that types search queries into a search engine. In this case, I'll want my agent to take the search query as an input.

</Frame>

Here I've set up a parameter called `search_query` that is a string. When I run my agent in my builder, the value of `search_query` will be `What is the weather like?`.

When I run my agent via API, I'll need to provide the actual input value the agent will use to type into the search engine.

```json
curl -X POST https://backend.trykura.com/run_agent \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "agent_id": "37eef9ddf627494488cad015967b842a",
  "parameters": {
    "search_query": "Who won the last Copa America?"
  },
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}'
```
