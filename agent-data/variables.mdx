Variables allow you to store and use data that your agent extracts through the execution of the agent.

## Variable Operations

### Creating Variables

Variables are automatically populated when creating [extraction blocks](/workflow-blocks/extraction) through the [AI Assistant](/ai-assistant/using-ai-assistant) or executing existing extraction blocks.

Populated variables are added into the Variables tab in the Builder after execution.

### Referencing Variables

Variables can be referenced to the AI Assistant or directly in prompts using `{variable_name}` syntax.

Note, however that that workflow blocks can only reference variables populated by extraction blocks that are executed prior to the workflow block.

#### Referencing Variables in For Loop Blocks

During iteration, use the variable name assigned to the name field in the for loop block to reference the current item in the loop.

- `{item.value}` represents the current item's value
- `{item.key}` represents either:
  - The object property name when iterating over an object
  - The numeric index (0, 1, 2, etc.) when iterating over an array

When these references are used, they will be automatically resolved to their current values during agent execution.
