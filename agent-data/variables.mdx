Variables allow you to store and manipulate data throughout your agent's execution lifecycle. They serve as temporary storage and can be modified as your agent performs its tasks.

## Variable Operations

### Input Variables

Input variables are available from the start of agent execution and can be referenced using curly bracket notation:

```javascript
// Reference input variables
const userInput = "{user_message}";
const systemPrompt = "{system_prompt}";
```

### Runtime Variables

Runtime variables are created by extraction blocks during agent execution and can be referenced using the block's name:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/data_extraction_variable.png"
    width="400"
    alt="Runtime variable extraction example"
  />
</Frame>

In this example, in later blocks, we can reference the extracted companies using `{company_names_list}`.

### Loop Variables

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/for_loop.png" width="400" alt="For loop variable example" />
</Frame>

During iteration, use the variable name assigned to the name field in the for loop block to reference the current item in the loop.

- `{item.value}` represents the current item's value
- `{item.key}` represents either:
  - The object property name when iterating over an object
  - The numeric index (0, 1, 2, etc.) when iterating over an array

When these references are used, they will be automatically resolved to their current values during agent execution.
