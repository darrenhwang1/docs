# Agent Output

Agent outputs are the results and data produced by your agent after completing its tasks. You can configure the output format in the Output tab of the builder interface.

## Output Types

Your agent can return data in the following formats:

- String
- Boolean
- Integer
- JSON

## Returning Variables

To return data stored in variables from your agent's execution, use the `${variable_name}` syntax. The `$` symbol distinguishes this from regular JSON notation.

### Example Usage

```javascript
// Return a single variable
${company_names_list}

// Combine multiple variables
{
  "companies": ${company_names_list},
  "timestamp": ${extraction_time},
  "total_count": ${company_count}
}
```

### Real-World Example

If you're building an agent to extract company names from Y Combinator:

```javascript
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "companies": ${company_names_list},
    "metadata": {
      "processedAt": ${processing_timestamp},
      "totalCompanies": ${total_companies}
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Output Formatting

- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Structure complex data in organized JSON objects
- Include relevant metadata when useful
