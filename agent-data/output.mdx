# Output

Outputs are the results and data produced by your agent after completing execution.

<Note>
  By default, the output of an agent includes all data extracted in data
  extraction blocks. You can customize this behavior as described below.
</Note>

Configuring output is optional and not needed, especially if you're using the agent to perform actions instead of extracting data.

You can configure the output format in the Output tab of the builder interface.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/output_tab.png" width="400" alt="Output tab" />
</Frame>

You have the ability to output any or all of the data extracted by your agent via a dropdown menu which contains all [Inputs](/agent-data/inputs) and [Variables](/agent-data/variables).

## Example

Let's say you have an agent that extracts both the name and the price of a product from a webpage into separate variables titled "product_name" and "product_price".

You can configure the output of your agent to output either or both of these variables.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/output_example.png" width="400" alt="Output example" />
</Frame>

When you run your agent, its output will now be a JSON object with the following format:

```json
{
  "product_name": PRODUCT_NAME,
  "product_price": PRODUCT_PRICE
}
```

where the `PRODUCT_NAME` and `PRODUCT_PRICE` are the values extracted by your agent.
