## How It Works

1. **Type what you want** - Tell the Recursion Agent your workflow in plain natural language
2. **Confirm or modify** - Approve the suggestion or ask for changes
3. **Watch it work** - The Recursion Agent executes on the web-page in real-time and adds the corresponding blocks to your workflow

## Self-Driving Mode (Beta)

For demos, proof of concepts, and simple automations, enable "Self Driving Mode" using the toggle at the top of the chat. This feature allows Recursion to automatically confirm and execute actions without manual approval.

## Examples of What You Can Type

**Simple instructions:**

- "Type example@example.com into the username field"
- "Click the login button"

**Multi-step instructions:**

- "Login with username: example@example.com and password: hunter2"
- "Go to the products page, find the first item with a 5-star rating, add it to the cart, and proceed to checkout"

## Tips for Best Results

- Be specific about what you want
- Use everyday language - no technical terms needed
- Review suggestions before confirming
- For complex workflows, you can break them into logical groups of instructions as if you were giving instructions to a new hire
