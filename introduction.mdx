If you're looking to build powerful browser agents using natural language, without the complexity of traditional development, you've come to the right place. Our builder provides an intuitive platform for creating reliable, production-ready AI agents through a streamlined workflow-based approach.

## Key Features

### Natural Language Agent Building

Design sophisticated AI agents using plain language.

### Rapid Iteration

Quickly prototype, test, and refine your agents with our intuitive interface, dramatically reducing development time.

### Enterprise-Grade Reliability

Build agents that perform consistently and reliably at scale, with built-in optimizations for speed and efficiency.

### Seamless Productionization

Take your agents from development to production in minutes, with built-in scaling and monitoring capabilities.

## Terminology

### Workflows

The complete end-to-end logic that defines your agent's behavior and capabilities. Think of it as the agent's brain - organizing how it thinks and acts.

### Workflow Blocks

The fundamental units of work that make up a workflow. Each block represents a specific task or decision point in your agent's logic, working together to create sophisticated behaviors.
